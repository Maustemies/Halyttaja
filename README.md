# Halyttaja

## Description
This application is designed to be a safe guard for vehicular confrontations.<br />
The driver, before making the trip, can start the software which monitors the acceleration sensors of the phone.<br />
If the acceleration sensors detect a large collision, an alarm is started and if not cancelled, a notification is propagated to the authorities.<br />
As the target user group is the Finnish population, the UI has to be in Finnish.<br />

## Requirements
* A great enough shake or a push applied to the phone generates an alarm.
* The alarm lasts for 60 seconds if not canceled by the user.
* If the alarm is not canceled, a notification is made to the authorities of the phone's last known location and the phone's user.
* The system can be started and canceled from one button.
* The user interface must be clear and concise.
* The user interface must be in Finnish.
