## Description
This application is designed to be a safe guard for vehicular confrontations.
The driver, before making the trip, can start the software which monitors the acceleration sensors of the phone.
If the acceleration sensors detect a large collision, an alarm is started and if not cancelled, a notification is propagated to the authorities.

## Requirements
* A great enough shake or a push applied to the phone generates an alarm.
* The alarm lasts for 60 seconds if not canceled by the user.
* If the alarm is not canceled, a notification is made to the authorities of the phone's last known location and the phone's user.
* The system can be started and canceled from one button.
* The user interface must be clear and concise.
